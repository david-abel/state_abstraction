SPACE SAVERS:
	Possibly remove outline to save space
	Possibly remove Nchain visual

Quick mathy fixes:
	Q_{max}
	phi_{model}
	dangling inequalities
	cases being aligned, using if
	epsilon to varepsilon
	No abs in final bounds
	Use of : and forall
	Q value Vs Q-value

Other fixes from Michael:

	Lemma 1 proof should have roadmap -- DONE
	
	Describe the approximate phi thingies much earlier (in the intro?) Maybe a table?
	Sentences about what each abstraction function is
	Introduce abstraction types in intro/earlier, that way Bolt/Mult don't need motivation when we're proving them
		> Michael's note on this one: %zzz all this theory is quite abstract. is there some way to weave in a running example and/or to at least provide some more motiviation for why phiBoltz is desirable. Balancing exploration/exploitation isn't really a motivation for why values should be abstracted together. What do the first two abstraction types miss that this one provides? We didn't Lihong et al. study it in the exact case?

	Redo visuals
		> Make lines thicker
		> (for Minefield, do it so it's vertical, that we we can say "top row")

	Redo plots
		> Make font bigger
		> Why are CIs consistently worse

	Why didn't we do all 4 abstraction classes: the other 3 reduce to Q* -- DONE

Go over bibliography make sure it looks nice.
