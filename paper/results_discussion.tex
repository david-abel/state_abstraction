\section{Approximate Abstraction on Example Domains}
%Explanation of what abstraction is used
We run experiments on aggregation functions in the $\epQ$ family of approximate abstractions. For each trial our aggregation greedily groups ground states into abstract states that in a way that satisfies the $\epQ$ criteria. The order in which ground states are grouped is randomized, so there is randomization across trials. Every ground state is equally weighted in its abstract state.

%Explanation of what plots done
For each domain we report two quantities as a function of epsilon with 95\% confidence bars. First, we compare the number of states in the abstract \ac{MDP} for different values of $\epsilon$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:main_empirical_results1}. The smaller the number of abstract states, the smaller the state space of the $\ac{MDP}$ that the agent must plan over. Second, we report the value under the abstract policy of the initial ground state, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:main_empirical_results2}. In the Taxi and Random domains, 200 trials are run for each data point, whereas 20 trials are run for data points in Minefield and NChain.

Our empirical results corroborate our thesis -- that approximate state abstractions can form the basis of learnable and useful state aggregation criteria. In both NChain and Minefield, we observe that as $\epsilon$ increases from $0$, the number of states which must be planned over is reduced, and optimal behavior is either fully maintained (NChain) or very nearly maintained (Minefield). Similarly for Taxi, when $\epsilon$ is between $.02$ and $.025$ we observe a reduction in the number of states in the abstract \ac{MDP} while value is fully maintained. After $.025$, increased reduction in state space size comes at a cost of value. Lastly, as $\epsilon$ is increased in the Random domain, there is a smooth reduction in the number of abstract states with a corresponding cost in the value of the derived policy.

Our experimental results also highlight a noteworthy characteristic of approximate state abstraction in goal-based \acp{MDP}. Taxi exhibits relative stability in state space size and behavior for epsilon up to $.02$ until both fall off dramatically. We attribute the sudden fall off of these quantities to its goal-based nature; once information critical for achieving optimal behavior is lost in the state aggregation, solving the goal -- and so acquiring any reward -- is unattainable. Conversely, in the Random domain, a great deal of near-optimal policies are available to the agent. Thus, even the information for optimal behavior is lost with an increase in $\epsilon$ there are a great deal of near-optimal policies available to the agent which are not lost by the abstraction.
