Questions to ask Michael about presentation of paper
----------------------------------------------------

In response to his comments:
	1. Title! Should be Approximate State Abstraction or Near optimal flubblubblub
	2. poly(\epsilon): It's a different polynomial for each function, so it'd be weird to present it any differently.
	3. Comment about "the" Q values. This is Q value in abstract vs. Q value in ground.
	4. State space switching mid stream:
		- Transition function is weirdly defined if we don't do this. T(phi(s), a, s') for the border case. Seems weird.
		- Seems doable the other way? We haven't done the math for this.
		Q: Do we think this is actually important?
	5. Weighting: we just haven't introduced it in the background. We'll reintroduce before we use in proof.

Other questions:
	- What aboot the other two proofs? What should we do for them?
	- Big picture: 
		> Thoughts on intro? Hit the right points?
		> Thoughts on handling of related work + framework paper?
	- Thoughts on the domains we chose
		> What do you think of minefield?
	- Thoughts on experimental section? Are those the right plots?
		> Splitting plot presentation into NChain plots, Minefield plots, etc. instead of EPS vs. NumStates and EPS vs. Value
