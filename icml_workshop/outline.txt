Introduce the setup:
	- two desiderata of abstraction.
	- why both are easily satisfied independently.
	- Mention that options have been studied extensively.
	- Using our abstraction framework we can characterize how options can fit the two desiderata

Related work:
	- Mostly options.
	- Empirically not sufficient
	- Theoretically not sufficient

Setup of SMDP abstraction stuff:

Preliminary REsults
