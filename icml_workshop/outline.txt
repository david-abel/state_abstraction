Introduce the setup:
	- two desiderata of abstraction.
	- why both are easily satisfied independently.
	- Mention that options have been studied extensively.
	- Using our abstraction framework we can characterize how options can fit the two desiderata

Related work:
	- Mostly options.
	- Empirically not sufficient
	- Theoretically not sufficient

Setup of SMDP abstraction stuff:

Preliminary REsults

Empirical pipeline

Future Work



Introduction:
	-Blah blah blah abstraciton
	-Summarize our ICML work
	-Propose 2 desiderata on abstraction
	-Characterize existing work on TE, skills and options in terms of desiderata
	-Propose extending our framework to handle TE and usch

Desiderata
	-What are they and why do we care?
		-Introduce 2 desirata
		-Some defense
	
	-Satisfying them...
		-Optimality trivially satisfied
			-Same MDP maintains value
		-Compressability
			-One state MDP
		-Together not trivially satisfied...

Our Formalism
	-Based on Lihong work.
	-Summarize why we want epsilon similarity in our paper (3 reasons) 
	-how options can fit into it -- MDP to AMDP to SMDP

Empricial Results?
